		<h1> System introduction 
		</h1>
		<p style="color:purple;"> Context </p> <p> Project Gutenberg is an online library of free eBooks founded by Michael Hart, the original creator of eBooks. Committed to remaining a free service, Project Gutenberg utilizes volunteers to digitize, archive, and distribute the free books within its collection. Its mission statement is: “To encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.”  In their mission statement, Project Gutenberg mentions that they strive for standards of accuracy on par with the U.S. Library of Congress (LOC). They encourage anyone to send in eBooks regardless of format or accuracy level, with the assurance that, over time, volunteers will convert them and correct errors.  As well they present the eBooks in the most common formats only. <br> 
        
		<p style="color:purple;"> Users </p>
		<p> Project Gutenberg’s user base is very broad. Gutenberg throws an incredibly large net by focusing on only offering its eBooks in e-reader friendly formats so that, according to their background page, everyone can use the service: “whether they are using a computer, a tablet, an e-reader, a mobile phone, or even if they are printing the eBooks on paper.”  <br>
	
		<p style="color:purple;"> Content <br>
		<p> Project Gutenberg strictly archives eBook versions of titles that are in the Public Domain; as of 2026, works published in 1930 or earlier no longer have copyright restrictions, and are thus archived in Project Gutenberg. All of Project Gutenberg’s collection is archived in the most widespread and basic formats, such as EPUB, HTML, or raw text, in order to ensure the longevity of the collection. For each item, it describes all of its eBooks such as book titles, authors, any associated dates, and other basic information. It focuses exclusively on eBooks, although it does include audiobook versions of some of the items in its collection as well. <br>
	<br> As of the time of writing this assignment, there are over seventy five thousand free eBooks within Project Gutenberg’s collection.

<h2> Discussion on the System </h2>
<p style="color:purple;">   Unique/interesting features the system supports </p>
<p> Project Gutenberg’s commitment to using only formats that cannot obsolesce such as raw text files for its eBooks, as well as other options like HTML and EPUB, makes it incredibly lightweight, versatile, and usable for a wide variety of users.  </p>

<p style="color:purple;"> Suggestions for improvement </p>
	<p> The UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) are serviceable but not particularly eye-grabbing or particularly effective at showcasing all of the wide collection that they have. This could be improved for clarity and appeal somewhat. </p>
